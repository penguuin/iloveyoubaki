    <h4 class="texts">I really can't believe its already been one year since I asked you to be mine. If it wasnt for dazzling and those first few messages on xbox we wouldn't be here, and actually I remember thnking well maybe she doesn't me since she never responded :(</h4>
    <img id="first2" src="./images/xboxmsg.png" alt="">
    <h4 class="texts">But I was wrong, you responded and you later got discord when I asked if you had it jaji. I enjoyed playing with you more than with anyone else and it was for that reason I asked you to get discord :D</h4>
    <img id="first1" src="./images/firstdcmessages.png" alt="">
    <h4 class="texts">Also throwback to this funny moment to the time I asked you to speedrun minecraft and you didn't even know what that was jaji</h4>
    <img src="./images/funny.png" alt="">
    <h4 class="texts">And you were always dry to me even from the start :(</h4>
    <img src="./images/dry.png" alt="">
    <h4 class="texts"> But anyways, I wanted to spend allll day with you everyday and I would always ask you to get on bc I had so much fun with you</h4>

    <h4 class="texts">And also, here was when I first got a sense of your kinkyness hehe</h4>
    <img src="./images/kinky.png" alt="">
    <h4 class="texts">But it wasnt always like this, in fact weve had so many ups and downs...</h4>
    <img src="./images/upset.png" alt="">
    <h4 class="texts">But its okay because in the end we end up okay, we figure it out and move on and grow closer together and that's what I love about this relationship and about you, I feel so comfortable talking to you about anything (althoguth ik ik i might not always open up) and it really is amazing. So I just want to thank you for this last year and a half of fun baby</h4>
